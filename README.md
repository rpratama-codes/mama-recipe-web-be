# ADD APP Environment Setting
# Fill NODE_ENV if you want to use cloud database in local
# this .env.local in the end is dosen't matter, because of
# on the production is using OS ENV.
#
# NODE_ENV = "production" or leave empty string
# APP_HOST = "" default is empty string
# PORT = "" default is 3000
#

NODE_ENV=
APP_HOST=
PORT=

# If you want to use cloud database in local fill NODE_ENV with production or leave it empty.
